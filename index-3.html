						<p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain,[note 8] is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands.[10] Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state—​​the Republic of Ireland.[note 9] Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants.[11] Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.

						<p>Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-by; Arabic: دبي‎‎ Dubayy, Gulf pronunciation: [dʊˈbɑj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[4] It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the country. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country's legislature.[5] The city of Dubai is located on the emirate's northern coastline and heads up the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Dubai is to host World Expo 2020.[6]

Dubai has emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East.[7] It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo. By the 1960s, Dubai's economy was based on revenues from trade and, to a smaller extent, oil exploration concessions, but oil was not discovered until 1966. Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969.[8] Dubai's oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.[9]

The emirate's Western-style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.[10][11][12] Dubai was recently named the best destination for Muslim travellers by Salam Standard.[13] Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events. The city has become iconic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Dubai has been criticised for human rights violations concerning the city's largely South Asian and Filipino workforce.[14] Dubai's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008–09 following the financial crisis of 2007–08,[15] but the emirate's economy has made a return to growth, with a projected 2015 budget surplus.[16]

As of 2012, Dubai was the 22nd most expensive city in the world and the most expensive city in the Middle East.[17][18] In 2014, Dubai's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world, after Geneva.[19] Dubai was rated as one of the best places to live in the Middle East by U.S. global consulting firm Mercer.[20].
